       <h2>Letters of Credit</h2>
       <p>The primary aim of this instrument is to provide increased assurance to both the buyer and seller of the fulfilment of each party’s obligations in a commercial trade. Due to the nature of international transactions, including factors such as distance, differing laws in each country, language/cultural barriers and difficulty in knowing each party personally, the use of letters of credit has become a very important aspect of international trade. <br><br>
        MAY INT exclusively acts as the country representative of <b>Bank of Huzhou (BOH)</b> to cover end-to-end correspondent banking services of Sino-Bangla trade amounting to US$16 bn a year. We have an established RMA relationship with 42 Bangladeshi banks in our network. BOH responds to “The Belt and Road” strategy by collaboration with Bangladeshi banks and at the same time helping to solve exporters’ difficulties in financing.

       <h2>Trade Loan Facilities and Buyers Credit</h2>
       <p>Trade loans work as fully revolving credit facilities that assist a business in funding its operations between the time it must pay for purchased products and the time it gets revenues from the sale of those goods. Trade loans are an important and well-established trade finance technique – enabling finance to be provided until payment for goods is received, particularly suited to wholesalers and manufacturers. <br><br>
        MAY INT can structure trade financing arrangements against <b>Upas</b> (Usance Payable at Sight) or <b>discounting</b> to suit your trading cycle and both regular and one-off financing needs. With the documentary credit UPAS clause, you can benefit from payment terms while allowing your supplier to be paid quickly. LC commission is charged by the issuing bank on a quarterly basis is against the LC settled amount. <br><br>

            <i>What can trade loans do for you?</i>

                <li class="mt-4">The product facilitates the payment of a Usance LC on sight to the exporter or seller, while payment settlement from the importer or buyer to the LC issuing bank occurs on the due date as per the contract terms. </li>
                <li class="mt-4">Can enhance your reputation with suppliers by allowing you to accept shorter payment terms.</li>
                <li class="mt-4">Could reduce your overall borrowing costs.</li>

       <h2>Standby Letter of Credit (SBLC)</h2>
       <p>An SBLC acts as a safety net for the payment of a shipment of physical goods or completed service to the seller, in the event something unforeseen prevents the buyer from making the scheduled payments to the seller. In such a case, the SBLC ensures the required payments are made to the seller after fulfilment of the required obligations.
