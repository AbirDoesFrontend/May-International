       <h2>Syndicated Foreign Currency Options</h2>
       <p>Syndicated loans arise when a project requires too large a loan for a single lender or when a project needs a specialized lender with expertise in a specific asset class. Lenders can distribute risk and participate in financial possibilities that are too huge for their own capital bases by syndicating the loan. <br>
         In 2015 and 2016, MAY International successfully raised a total of USD 105 million for <b>AB Bank</b> through a Syndicated loan arrangement against bond with Noor Bank Dubai (now Dubai Islamic Bank) acting as the lead arranger. With this expertise and experience, MAY INT continues to be a market leader in arranging alternative bank facilities.

       <h2>Structured Financing</h2>
       <p>Structured finance is a financial instrument available for companies with complex financing needs, which cannot be usually solved with conventional financing methods. Moreover, traditional lenders often do not offer structured financing. <br>
         MAY INT assist companies in raising cash through a variety of financial instruments, including term loans, syndicated loans in both local and foreign currency, Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), hybrid securities, collateralized bond obligations (CBOs), among others.
